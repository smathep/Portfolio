# Portfolio Website

This website was made from scratch, originally in raw HTML/CSS, but now I'm moving it to use React. This gives me experience with HTML, CS, React, and AWS using S3, CloudFront, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild. CI/CD is setup to automatically deploy code to the S3 bucket and invalidate the CloudFront cache.
