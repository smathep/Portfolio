        <h2>Mandelbrot</h2>
        <p>
            This is a multithreaded Java program that allows you to save an image of the Mandelbrot set.
            The user can choose the coordinates of the set to center around, the zoom lever, and the number of threads to use in the rendering process. 
            The code and documentation for this app is available on <a id="links" href="https://github.com/smathep/Mandelbrot">GitHub</a>.

        <h2>Conway's Game Of Life</h2>
        <p>
            This is a Java program from high school based on John Conway's Game of Life. The user can choose from different preset game board sizes, as well as different preset gameboard setups like boards with oscillators, still lifes, gliders, spaceships, empty grids for customization, or random boards. The user can then control the speed at which the simulaiton runs, pause running, click to change a cell's status, and step through simulation rounds. The code and documentation for this app is available on <a id="links" href="https://github.com/smathep/GameOfLife">GitHub</a>.
